"""Generate replay tasks from a repo's git history (our fork of ninja's `Generate`).

Ninja picks one commit and asks the agent to reproduce it. We instead pick a freeze
point T with enough history before it and at least `horizon` commits after it, and treat
those next-N commits as the **revealed maintainer actions** — the reference trajectory.
