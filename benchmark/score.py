"""Scoring helpers.

Two layers (proposal §4):
- `trajectory_overlap` — a lexical Jaccard diagnostic only; NOT used to rank.
- `objective_score` — the deterministic, un-gameable anchor: it grades a plan against
  *structural ground truth* from the revealed window (which top-level modules actually
  changed, whether a release happened), not against free-text similarity. This is the part
  that resists prose-fluff, since it keys off real changed file paths.

Neither is the final ranking (that's the pairwise judge); the objective score anchors it.
