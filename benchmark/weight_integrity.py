"""Gate whether a replay artifact's blend weights are present and valid.

``run_replay`` records the ``weights`` used to blend the judge and objective components into each
task's ``composite``. :mod:`benchmark.row_integrity` and :mod:`benchmark.score_integrity` *consume*
those weights when verifying scores, but nothing checks that the weights themselves are sound. A
hand-edited artifact could omit ``weights`` or declare a zero-sum (or negative) blend, silently
changing every downstream composite while still passing the score checks that trust the declared
weights.

``check_weight_integrity(result)`` verifies, for each scored replay slice, that:

1. ``weights_present`` — the slice carries a ``weights`` object holding both ``judge`` and
   ``objective`` keys;
2. ``weights_non_negative`` — both components are finite, non-negative numbers (a negative,
   ``NaN``/``inf``, non-numeric, or ``numpy`` value fails rather than being silently dropped);
3. ``weights_sum_positive`` — ``judge + objective`` is strictly greater than zero, so the blend
   actually weights something.

Missing components and invalid components are reported by separate checks. Single-repo, multi-repo
(``per_repo``), and ``--generalization`` (``tuned``/``held_out``) artifacts are each checked per
scored slice. The companion ``scripts/weight_integrity.py`` exits non-zero when any slice's weights
are unsound.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the result; malformed/non-dict input fails with explicit
checks rather than raising.
