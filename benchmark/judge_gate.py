"""Gate whether a run's pairwise judge was robust enough to trust its verdicts.

The M2/M3 acceptance leans on judge robustness — "pairwise judging, dual-order consistency,
disagreement tracking." A composite score is only as trustworthy as the judge behind it: if the
run was judged in a single presentation order, or the two orders disagreed on a large fraction
of tasks, the win/loss record (and the ``judge_mean`` half of the composite) is shaky.
``run_eval`` reports the judge stats, but whether they clear the bar is decided by eye.

This makes that a reproducible **pass/fail gate**. ``check_judge(result)`` evaluates a
single- or multi-repo run against named criteria. A ``run_generalization_report`` nests its judge
telemetry under ``tuned``/``held_out`` with none at the top level; it is evaluated on its **tuned**
partition (the headline figure, mirroring ``benchmark.trend.headline_score`` and
``check_promotion``), so a generalization run is judged on its merits instead of failing every
check vacuously. The criteria:

1. ``dual_order_judging`` - the run judged both presentation orders, the mode that yields a
   consistency signal at all. A single-repo run states this directly in its top-level
   ``judge_dual_order`` flag (authoritative when present); a multi-repo aggregate omits that
   flag, so the status is derived from the aggregate dual-order task count (``> 0`` means both
   orders were judged), failing closed when neither the flag nor that count is available;
2. ``enough_dual_order_tasks`` - at least ``min_dual_order_tasks`` tasks were judged in both
   orders, so the disagreement rate is measured on a meaningful sample;
3. ``low_disagreement`` - the order-``disagreement_rate`` is at most ``max_disagreement`` (the
   judge's verdicts are stable across order, not flipping on presentation). The rate is
   recomputed from ``judge_order_stats`` when available (``disagree`` / ``dual_order_tasks``),
   falling back to ``judge_report.disagreement_rate`` only when stats are absent — mirroring
   ``_dual_order_tasks`` — so a stale report field cannot false-pass the gate.

The companion ``scripts/judge_gate.py`` exits non-zero when the judge isn't robust, so a run's
verdicts can be gated in CI before they're trusted.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the result, and a malformed/non-dict result simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
