"""Gate a candidate benchmark run against a baseline run for regressions.

``compare_eval`` *reports* the diff between two artifacts and ``trend`` tracks a score over many
runs; neither yields a **pass/fail decision** you can gate CI on for a single before/after pair.
This does: given a ``baseline`` artifact (the last accepted run) and a ``candidate`` artifact
(this run), ``check_regression`` decides whether the candidate is safe to accept — it must not
drop the headline composite by more than ``max_composite_drop``, and must not make the pairwise
judge materially less stable (order-``disagreement_rate`` rising by more than
``max_disagreement_increase``). Disagreement rates are recomputed from ``judge_order_stats`` when
available, falling back to ``judge_report`` only when stats are absent — mirroring ``check_judge``.

The companion ``scripts/regression.py`` exits non-zero when a regression is found, so a run can
be gated against the previous baseline the way ``--fail-under`` gates against a fixed floor —
useful when the *floor moves with the current best* rather than being a constant.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates its inputs, and a malformed/non-dict artifact simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
