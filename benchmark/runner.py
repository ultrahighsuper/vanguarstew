"""Orchestrate the time-travel replay: freeze -> run agents -> pairwise judge -> tally.

The agent entrypoint is loaded by file path (as ninja's validator loads `agent.py`), so the
top-level `agent.py` module and the `agent/` package don't collide. For MVP the challenger is
compared against a naive baseline maintainer; in M2+ this becomes challenger-vs-king.
