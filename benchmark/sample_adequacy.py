"""Gate whether a run judged enough tasks, and accounted for all of them, to be trustworthy.

A composite from two tasks is noise; the M1 acceptance wants a real "win/loss record", which
presumes a meaningful, fully-accounted sample. ``run_eval`` reports the task count, but nothing
stops a headline computed from a handful of tasks - or one where tasks silently vanished between
judging and tallying - from flowing into ``compare_eval`` / ``trend`` / a leaderboard as if it
were as solid as a full run.

This makes sample adequacy a reproducible **pass/fail gate**. ``check_sample_adequacy(result)``
evaluates named criteria across single-repo (``run_replay``) and multi-repo (``run_multi_replay``
/ ``--generalization``) results, and every check **fails closed** - a check never passes without
positively verifying its condition:

1. ``run_scored`` - the run produced a trustworthy task total: no ``error``, a positive count, and
   (for a multi-repo result) *every* per-repo entry is a well-formed dict with a numeric task
   count. A single malformed per-repo entry makes the total untrustworthy and fails this check
   rather than being silently skipped.
2. ``enough_tasks`` - the total number of tasks judged is at least ``min_tasks``.
3. ``all_tasks_decided`` - a challenger/baseline/tie tally is present and sums to the task total,
   so no task was dropped between judging and tallying. A missing tally, a tally missing a key, or
   a tally that under-/over-counts the tasks **fails** this check (a run that can't show every
   task was decided is not adequately accounted for).

The companion ``scripts/sample_adequacy.py`` exits non-zero when the sample is inadequate.

Pure evaluation: no I/O, never mutates the result, and a malformed/non-dict result simply fails
the relevant checks rather than raising.
