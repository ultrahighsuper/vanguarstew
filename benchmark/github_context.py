"""Enrich a frozen snapshot with GitHub state that was knowable at time T.

`freeze.py` gives us git-only context (commits, tags, README). This adds the maintainer's
real working surface — open issues, open PRs, milestones, releases, and other fields we can
defend *as of T* — so nothing from the future leaks: an item counts as "open at T" only if it
was created on or before T and was not already closed by T.

Network access is optional. Any failure (offline, rate limit, private repo) is caught and
the git-only context is returned unchanged, so the benchmark still runs without GitHub.

Field stability (``fetch_context_at``)
--------------------------------------
Derived as-of-T (safe):
  - Issue/PR membership: ``created_at`` / ``closed_at`` gate open-at-T selection.
  - Issue/PR labels: reconstructed from timeline ``labeled``/``unlabeled`` events when
    available; omitted (not copied live) when the timeline is unavailable.
  - Issue/PR ``title``: reconstructed from timeline ``renamed`` events when the timeline is
    complete; omitted (not copied live) when the timeline is unavailable or truncated.
  - Milestone ``state``: derived from ``closed_at`` relative to T, not the live API field.
  - Releases: filtered by ``published_at <= T`` (drafts, which carry no ``published_at``,
    are excluded).

Live, copied as-is (no cheap as-of-T source):
  - Issue/PR ``number`` and ``created_at``: immutable, so the live value already equals the
    as-of-T value.

Omitted (no created-at or editable after T, so not reconstructable as-of-T — dropped rather
than leaked as a present-day value):
  - Repo ``labels`` catalog: the labels endpoint carries no created-at, so its live list
    would leak today's set; not fetched at all (``fetch_context_at`` returns no ``labels``).
  - Milestone ``due_on``: the REST value is today's editable due date, so a post-T edit would
    leak; dropped rather than carried as a possibly-future value.
