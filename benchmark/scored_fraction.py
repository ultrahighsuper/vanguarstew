"""Report the scored fraction of a replay artifact — the share of repos that produced a score.

A replay set has ``repos`` repositories; only ``scored_repos`` of them produce composite scores. The
headline ``composite_mean`` is a mean over the scored repos, so a run that scored only a handful of a
large set can still look healthy. This read-only utility reports ``scored_repos / repos`` — the
coverage of the set — with per-partition (``tuned``/``held_out``) detail plus a summed overall for a
``--generalization`` artifact.

Pure analysis: no I/O, never mutates its input. The fraction is derived from ``repos`` and
``scored_repos`` alone (never gated on an optional ``skipped`` field); a zero/negative repo count, a
negative ``scored``, ``scored > repos``, or non-integer counts yield ``None`` rather than a
misleading value, and the headline degrades to ``n/a`` on a non-finite fraction.
